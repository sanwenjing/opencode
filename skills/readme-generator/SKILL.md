 What I do
- Analyze project structure and dependencies to understand the codebase
- Generate comprehensive README.md with proper sections

 When to use me
Use this when you need to:
- Create a new README for an existing project
- Update an outdated README with current project information
- Generate documentation for a new repository
- Standardize README format across multiple projects

 How I work
1. Examine project files (package.json, source code, config files)
2. Identify project type, framework, and main features
3. Generate appropriate sections based on project characteristics
4. Include interactive examples and code snippets when possible
5. Suggest relevant badges and links for enhanced visibility

 Sections I typically include
- Project title and description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Contributing guidelines
- License information
